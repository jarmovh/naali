<h2>Sound</h2>
Represents in-world sound source. The audio clip to play is specified in the soundRef attribute. Setting
the soundRef attribute does not immediately trigger sound playback. Use the "PlaySound" action to do it.

@note If the spatial attribute is true, and th entity this EC_Sound is part of contains an EC_Placeable 
    component, this sound clip is treated as a spatial (3D) sound. Otherwise, the sound is treated as a
    nonpositional (ambient) sound.

@note If sound attributes has been changed while the audio clip is on playing state, user needs to call
UpdateSoundSettings() to apply those changes into the Audio API.

<b>Attributes</b>:
<ul>
<li>AssetReference: soundRef
<div>Sound asset reference that is used to request a sound from sound service.</div> 
<li>float: soundInnerRadius
<div>Sound inner radius tell the distance where sound gain value is in it's maximum.</div> 
<li>float: soundOuterRadius
<div>Sound outer radius tell the distance where sound gain value is zero.</div> 
<li>float: soundGain
<div>Sound gain value should be between 0.0-1.0</div> 
<li>bool: loopSound
<div>Do we want to loop the sound until the stop sound is called.</div> 
<li>bool: spatial
<div>If true, the audio source is played back as a spatial (3D) sound source. This requires a 
EC_Placeable component to be present in the same entity as this EC_Sound component. Otherwise,
the sound is played back as a nonspatial audio clip.</div> 
</ul>

<b>Exposes the following scriptable functions:</b>
<ul>
<li>"PlaySound": Starts playing the sound.
<li>"StopSound": Stops playing the sound.
<li>"UpdateSoundSettings": Get each attribute value and send them over to sound service.

<b>Reacts on the following actions:</b>
<ul>
<li>"PlaySound": Starts playing the sound.
