/// IComponent is the base class for all user-created components. Inherit your own components from this class.
/** Each Component has a compile-time specified type name that identifies the class-name of the Component.
    This differentiates different derived implementations of the IComponent class. Each implemented Component
    must have a unique type name.

    Additionally, each Component has a Name string, which identifies different instances of the same Component,
    if more than one is added to an Entity.

    A Component consists of a list of Attributes, which are automatically replicatable instances of scene data.
    See IAttribute for more details.

    Every Component has a state variable 'UpdateMode' that specifies a default setting for managing which objects
    get notified whenever an Attribute change event occurs. This is used to create "Local Only"-objects as well
    as when doing batch updates of Attributes (for performance or correctness).
